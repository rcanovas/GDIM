Genotyped Data Imputation and Analysis
======================================

During 2018, I started to research the applications of genomic prediction to common disease, particularly autoimmunity.Being new in this area I have been learning how to prepare and analyse data in plink format (bim/bed/fam) before and after imputation (using the `Michigan Server`_).

.. _`Michigan Server`: https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html

Here, I present a guide of the steps and scripts that I have used. Note that, these steps applied to what I have been done, and they may not completly apply to other studies.

code::
        print 'hello'
        >> hello
